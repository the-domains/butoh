**Butoh  **[舞踏][0]_Butō_

is a form of Japanese dance theatre that encompasses a diverse range of activities, techniques and motivations for [dance][1] , performance, or movement. Following [World War II][2], butoh arose in 1959 through collaborations between its two key founders [Hijikata Tatsumi][3] and [Ohno Kazuo][4]. 

Common features of the art form include playful and grotesque imagery, taboo topics, extreme or absurd environments, and it is traditionally performed in white body makeup with slow hyper-controlled motion. However, with time butoh groups are increasingly being formed around the world, with their various aesthetic ideals and intentions.
